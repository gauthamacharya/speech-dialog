In this demo scenario, 
Our customer purchases a blue tooth speaker, but doesn't receive it even after the promised delivery date. 

The customer calls customer care and tries to navigate through a web of menu options. 

Our customer is put on hold for a long duration. The customer is frustrated and is very unlikely to ever do business with the retailer.

If only our retailer had deployed Commerce Congnitive Service Assistant,  the customer experience would be very different.

The customer would use his phone app and reach out to the virtual customer agent to get his concerns addressed. 

The interactions would be just like he would have with a real human agent but without all the wait and frustration.

Lets see how the conversation proceeds
